# Vecmocon_Loan_Management_App

Worked on a self-initiated product case study, where I conceptualized a digital loan management app for two-wheeler financing. The goal was to improve onboarding, repayment efficiency, and fraud prevention. I scoped the MVP roadmap using the RICE framework, prioritizing fraud detection, repayment alerts, and risk scoring dashboards, and designed wireframes for onboarding, EMI calculator, repayment tracking, and dashboards using the CIRCLES framework with UI layouts in Illustrator. To ensure market success, I proposed a GTM strategy with digital campaigns, AI-based verification, and integrated risk tools, projecting around a 25% boost in repayment compliance. This project reflects my ability to think end-to-end as a product managerâ€”from identifying pain points to building user flows and mapping measurable business impact.
